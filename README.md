mass pulls tokens from tokens.txt and checks for a valid xbox code on the token
if there is a code found it will print code found with and print to codes.txt and delete the token used from tokens.txt
if no code is found it prints no code found and delete the token used from tokens.txt then proceed onto the next token
proxys are not needed tested it with 100 accounts no ratelimits found make a issue if i am wrong
